  # Redundancy

  Redundancy:
    description: >-
      Targets must have a `minimum-count` number of instances and will not have more than
      a `maximum-count` number of instances.
    properties:
      minimum-count:
        description: >-
          A value of zero is possible, in which case the targets will have no instances.
        type: Count
        default: 1
      maximum-count:
        description: >-
          Must be equal to or greater than `minimum-count`. If not specified, there is no
          maximum.

  Affinity:
    description: >-
      Base type for affinity policies.

  Colocation:
    description: >-
      Deploy all target instances to the same host.

  Separation:

          If true, absolutely requires instances to be separated. If false, it is only

  # Placement

  Placement:
    description: >-
      Base type for policies that place instances on hosts.
    properties:

        required: false

  Scattering:
    description: >-
      Deploy each target instance to a different host.

      If there are not enough hosts selected to satisfy a `Redundancy` policy's `minimum-count`,
      then behavior depends on our `allow-colocation` property. If false (the default), then
      deployment would fail until additional hosts are selectable. If true, then some instances
      would share hosts and an effort would be made to reduce the number of instances per
      host.

      allow-colocation:
        type: boolean
        default: false

  Distribution:
    description: >-
      Deploy all target instances to all hosts.

      If there are not enough hosts selected to satisfy a `Redundancy` policy's `minimum-count`,
      then behavior depends on our `allow-colocation` property. If false (the default), then
      deployment would fail until additional hosts are selectable. If true, then some instances
      would share hosts and an effort would be made to reduce the number of instances per
      host.

      If a `Redundancy` policy's `maximum-count` is smaller than the number of selected hosts,
      then behavior depends on our `allow-partial` property. If false (the default), then
      deployment would fail until fewer hosts are selected. If true, them some hosts would
      not have instances.
